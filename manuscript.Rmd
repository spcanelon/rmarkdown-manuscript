# Getting started

## Set up an RStudio project if you don't have one already

```{r create-project, eval=FALSE}
# filepath ends with the name of your project
# example: rmarkdown-manuscript

usethis::create_project(
  '/Users/scanelon/Documents/Repos/Teaching/rmarkdown-manuscript/'
)
```

```{bash project-tree, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
.
├── .Rproj.user
├── .gitignore
├── R
└── rmarkdown-manuscript.Rproj
```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
